                    As our smallest budget rooms, the Compact bedrooms are suited for single occupancy or short-stay double occupancy as
                    they have limited space and storage. This room is amazing, it has everything you want, everything you deserve. Take
                    it now for a comfortable price.

                            staff are very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable regarding places to visit in Prague. The hotel is very clean
                            throughout, and our room was spacious with everything that we needed. Breakfast was substantial, and suited all tastes.
